MORSE (Modular OpenRobots simulation Engine) is a Blender-based robotic simulator.
It is a BSD-licensed project (cf LICENSE).

It is meant to be versatile (simulation of field robotics, indoor robotics, 
multi-robots systems) and allow simulation at different levels (from raw 
cameras to high-level semantics).

The communication with the simulator is middleware independent and (will) rely
on Genom3 for automatic generation of bindings.

I/ Installation
---------------

Please read INSTALL.

II/ Documentation

III/ How to contribute
----------------------

Even if the code-base is not stabilized yet, contribution to MORSE are more 
than welcome.

You can contribute new robot models, new sensors, we have a TODO list for the 
Blender game engine itself...
