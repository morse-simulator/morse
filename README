=======================================================================

MORSE (Modular OpenRobots simulation Engine) is a Blender-based robotic
simulator.  It is a BSD-licensed project (cf LICENSE).

It is meant to be versatile (simulation of field robotics, indoor
robotics, human robot interaction, multi-robots systems) and allow
simulation at different levels (from raw cameras to high-level
semantics).

The communication with the simulator is middleware independent. At the
moment, MORSE supports the following middlewares:

- ROS
- Yarp
- pocolibs
- MOOS
- socket

I/ Installation

III/ How to contribute
----------------------

Even if the code-base is not stabilized yet, contribution to MORSE are
more than welcome.

You can contribute new robot models, new sensors, we have a TODO list
for the Blender game engine itself...
