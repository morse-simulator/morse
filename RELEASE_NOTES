MORSE 0.4 - "Nearing Multinode" release
=======================================

General changes
---------------

Architectural changes
---------------------
- Added infrastructure for multi-node functionality
- Use the Builder API to create robots from their description in Python script.
- Use the Python logging interface

Middlewares
-----------
- Added support for multiple middleware bindings per component
- Added support for services through  Pocolibs middleware
- ROS support for the robot's cameras


MORSE 0.3 - "Itizpossible" release
==================================

General changes
---------------
- Added preliminary support for Blender 2.57 (with Python 3.2)
- Removed support for Blender 2.49

Architectural changes
---------------------

- MORSE now support *services* to configure components
  and the general behaviour of the simulation at runtime. Services
  can be either synchronous or asynchronous.
- Addition of a variable to keep track of the time elapsed in seconds
  since the simulation started.

Middlewares
-----------

- Initial support for the ROS (http://www.ros.org) middleware.
- ROS: Odometry, joint state and laser scanner sensors are exported using standard
  messages.
- Sockets: services (RPC) are available
- YARP: services (RPC) are available

New sensors/actuators
---------------------

- clever waypoint controller that avoids obstacles

Simulation supervision
----------------------

- Add a shortcut to switch between camera during the simulation (F9)
- Add a shortcut to replace all objects at their initial position without
  relaunching the simulation (F11)
- Add support for the Wiimote to control the human in HRI simulations
  (external tool using socket-based requests)
- Requests: ensure some working control of the simulation
  based on the socket interface (only restart for now)

MORSE 0.2 - The HRI release
===========================

General changes
---------------

- Switch to Blender 2.5: MORSE now officialy supports Blender 2.5x (x>=4) and 
  the support for Blender 2.49 has been dropped.

- This means that MORSE is now fully Python 3 compatible. New code must be from
  now valid Python 3 code.

- MORSE homepage is now http://morse.openrobots.org/

- Documentation has been converted to reStructuredText. HTML version automatically updated
  every hour to http://morse.openrobots.org/doc/

- A MORSE bugtracker is now available: https://softs.laas.fr/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=morse

Architectural changes
---------------------

- Components have "hooks" to export their data. Middleware lives in parallel
  threads and "visit" the components. In this case, middlewares still lives
  in the Python VM. Advantage: better decoupling ; middleware can dynamically
  choose what they want to watch.

- Add 'serialize' methods to the data of each component. This formats the 
data according to the needs of each middleware/architecture.


Support for human-robot interaction
-----------------------------------

- MORSE now offers a human model. It can be controlled in a "first person shooter"-like
  mode, enabling immersive simulation of human-robot interaction:
   - mouse-based interactive displacement and grasping of objects (using IK to ensure 
     consistent, fully body motion)
   - 40-DOF human posture (joint state) is exported by a new sensor called 'human_posture'

New sensors/actuators
---------------------

- Support for the PA-10 and Kuka arms. They can be controlled either by specifying
  a target that the arm tries to reach (using Blender ITASC IK solver) or by
  sending a set of joint angles.

- new simple waypoint controller: this 'high-level' controller allows to give 
  only a list of waypoint to the robot. The simulator takes care of the navigation 
  (currently, simple straight lines, without any sort of obstacle avoidance)

- "Semantic camera" sensor: MORSE can export position, orientation and name 
  of specifically marked objects that are visible by a camera.

- we now have a fully simulated SICK laser sensor.

Other features
--------------

- Possibility to control the camera when the game engine runs (with keyboard, 
  mouse, or attach some view to some robots)
- Support for Ubuntu 10.04 (hi Lorenz!)
- Added LAAS Jido robot model with Kuka arm
- fixed several issues with camera calibration in Blender
- Added several posters for Genom middleware
- Fixed the accelerometer sensor
- fixed several issues with transformation coordinates
