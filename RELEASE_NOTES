MORSE 0.6
=========

General
-------

- Lots of improvents on ROS compatibility. Many new tutorials with detailed
  explanations
- Compatibility with Blender 2.63a and 2.64 (2.63a is the minimum)
- MORSE is now compatible with Windows 32 and 64 bit. Thanks to Markus Sander
  for providing the patches and testing
- Improvements in human-robot interaction scenarios
- The 'morse' executable has slightly different options now. run 'morse -h' for
  details.
- Added support for 'no color' and 'reverse colors' log output.
- Added support for specifying the geometry of the simulator window.
- Improvements to the multi-node architecture using HLA. Including new
  tutorials and documentation
- Add methods in builder to configure UTM coordinates and temperature in the scene. Previously in the Scene_Script_Holder

User interface
--------------

- Possibility to configure and display the view from a simulated camera inside
  the Blender screen
- Reset the position of the global camera (CameraFP) by pressing F8

Components
----------

- New more physically realistic robots: Segway RMP 400 and Pioneer 3-DX. Thanks
  to David Hodo and Pierrick Koch for their work on the physics simulation
- New differential drive actuator associated to the previously mentioned
  robots, called 'v_omega_diff_drive'. It converts a given v, omega into left
  and right wheel speeds
- Waypoint actuator can be configured to give target destination also in the Z
  axis. Useful for helicopters and submarines
- Human avatar can now be correctly placed in the scene using the Builder API
  scripts
- New textured model for the Yamaha R-Max helicopter
- Corrections to the bounding boxes of buildings in outdoor scenarios. Also
  added textures to the buildings

Middlewares
-----------

- Corrections to YARP middleware, allowing it to export data stored as Python
  lists

Documentation
-------------

- Make table of contents of the components with images

MORSE 0.5
=========

General
-------

- MORSE 0.5 requires Blender >= 2.59 and < 2.62 (because of some changes in the
  matrices handling - support for Blender >= 2.62 is expected for next release)
- Lots of cleaning (middleware empties have been removed)
- The command line ``morse run {scene.blend|scene.py}`` now works as expected (*i.e.*,
  starts the simulation as soon as Blender opens).
  Optional arguments can be added and are passed to the script
- Unit-testing support for MORSE (cf doc: dev/testing). Added a target to the build file
  ('make test').

GUI
---

- First version of a graphical user interface to add components to a scene
- Plugin for loading DTM/IGN data has been ported to Blender 2.5/Python 3.2

Middlewares
-----------

- Support of ROS services. Partial support for ROS actions (cf commit 02fda)
- The long-standing issue with the socket server (bug #162) has been solved. It
  is now possible to listen to a socket stream without prior initialization.

Builder API
-----------

- New export script (available as Blender add-on) to export a MORSE Blender
  scene to the MORSE Builder format.
- Added support for multi-node configuration in the builder API
- Added support for static, passive objects
- Many examples and tutorials have been converted to the Builder API.

Components
----------

- Static objects have a redefined set of options to make them active or not,
  graspable or not, etc. See :doc:`user/others/passive_objects`)
- New components that can be created from the Builder API, such as:

  - Infrared sensor
  - Battery sensor
  - Light switch actuator
- Camera images can now be vertically flipped via the ``vertical_flip`` property

Multi-node
----------

- New abstract API for multi-node implementation. The current socket-based and HLA
  implementation now use it
- This allows for having a single builder script to be used on all nodes. The
  configuration of each node is done using the environment variable ``MORSE_NODE``

HRI
---

Much work has been done in this domain:

- New human avatar with a much improved behaviour/animation. It is controllable
  from mouse + keyboard or Kinect (experimental)
- The avatar features a 'manipulation mode' where objects can be picked and
  dropped, and special objects like drawers and cupboards can be opened.
- The human avatar can be easily added via the Builder API (instantiate the
  'Human' class)



MORSE 0.4.x - "Multinode" release
=================================

General changes
---------------
- Full support for Blender 2.59 and Python 3.2.
- Reorganized the documentation, with a brand new main page.

Architectural changes
---------------------
- Added infrastructure for multi-node functionality
- Use the Builder API to create robots from their description in Python script
- Changed directory structure and file names for ease of use of the Builder API
- Use the Python logging interface

Middlewares
-----------
- Added support for multiple middleware bindings per component
- Added support for services through  Pocolibs middleware
- ROS support for the robot's cameras
- Added support for HLA middleware
- Added support for MOOS middleware

New components
--------------
- Added a Hummer robot that implements the Blender Vehicle Wrapper
- Added a 'steer_force' actuator to control the Hummer robot
- Added an 'armature_actuator' to control the bone structure in the LWR and PR2 robot arms

User interface
--------------
- Add a help display with the keyboard shortcuts available during simulation. Activated by pressing the 'H' key

MORSE 0.3 - "Itizpossible" release
==================================

General changes
---------------
- Added preliminary support for Blender 2.57 (with Python 3.2)
- Removed support for Blender 2.49

Architectural changes
---------------------

- MORSE now support *services* to configure components
  and the general behaviour of the simulation at runtime. Services
  can be either synchronous or asynchronous.
- Addition of a variable to keep track of the time elapsed in seconds
  since the simulation started.

Middlewares
-----------

- Initial support for the ROS (http://www.ros.org) middleware.
- ROS: Odometry, joint state and laser scanner sensors are exported using standard
  messages.
- Sockets: services (RPC) are available
- YARP: services (RPC) are available

New sensors/actuators
---------------------

- clever waypoint controller that avoids obstacles

Simulation supervision
----------------------

- Add a shortcut to switch between camera during the simulation (F9)
- Add a shortcut to replace all objects at their initial position without
  relaunching the simulation (F11)
- Add support for the Wiimote to control the human in HRI simulations
  (external tool using socket-based requests)
- Requests: ensure some working control of the simulation
  based on the socket interface (only restart for now)

MORSE 0.2 - The HRI release
===========================

General changes
---------------

- Switch to Blender 2.5: MORSE now officialy supports Blender 2.5x (x>=4) and 
  the support for Blender 2.49 has been dropped.

- This means that MORSE is now fully Python 3 compatible. New code must be from
  now valid Python 3 code.

- MORSE homepage is now http://morse.openrobots.org/

- Documentation has been converted to reStructuredText. HTML version automatically updated
  every hour to http://morse.openrobots.org/doc/

- A MORSE bugtracker is now available: https://softs.laas.fr/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=morse

Architectural changes
---------------------

- Components have "hooks" to export their data. Middleware lives in parallel
  threads and "visit" the components. In this case, middlewares still lives
  in the Python VM. Advantage: better decoupling ; middleware can dynamically
  choose what they want to watch.

- Add 'serialize' methods to the data of each component. This formats the 
data according to the needs of each middleware/architecture.


Support for human-robot interaction
-----------------------------------

- MORSE now offers a human model. It can be controlled in a "first person shooter"-like
  mode, enabling immersive simulation of human-robot interaction:
   - mouse-based interactive displacement and grasping of objects (using IK to ensure 
     consistent, fully body motion)
   - 40-DOF human posture (joint state) is exported by a new sensor called 'human_posture'

New sensors/actuators
---------------------

- Support for the PA-10 and Kuka arms. They can be controlled either by specifying
  a target that the arm tries to reach (using Blender ITASC IK solver) or by
  sending a set of joint angles.

- new simple waypoint controller: this 'high-level' controller allows to give 
  only a list of waypoint to the robot. The simulator takes care of the navigation 
  (currently, simple straight lines, without any sort of obstacle avoidance)

- "Semantic camera" sensor: MORSE can export position, orientation and name 
  of specifically marked objects that are visible by a camera.

- we now have a fully simulated SICK laser sensor.

Other features
--------------

- Possibility to control the camera when the game engine runs (with keyboard, 
  mouse, or attach some view to some robots)
- Support for Ubuntu 10.04 (hi Lorenz!)
- Added LAAS Jido robot model with Kuka arm
- fixed several issues with camera calibration in Blender
- Added several posters for Genom middleware
- Fixed the accelerometer sensor
- fixed several issues with transformation coordinates
