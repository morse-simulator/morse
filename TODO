=========================================================
 TARGETS FOR RELEASE 0.2 - The Human Interaction release
=========================================================

User-interface
--------------
- Control a human as "first person shooter": Ability to pick/release objects by
 clicking on them

Middlewares
-----------
- Requests: be sure that components can be remotely (ie by clients) configured

Components
----------
- Arm control: support setting the position of arms by reading a set 
of angles
- Animated human export: MORSE should export the complete armature of the human


=========================
 TARGETS FOR RELEASE 0.3
=========================

Middlewares
-----------
- Full ROS support

Architecture
------------
- how components access other components? (eg: the cameras need the position of the robot)

Components
----------

- Motion capture poster: MORSE should be able to simulate a motion capture setup
by allowing the designer to paste markers in the scene whose position will be exported
- "Point Cloud" sensor
- clever waypoint controller that avoid obstacles

Coding style
------------

- Replace all "print" by the Python logging interface
- every simple function must have a function comment ( """ ... """) + setup the
  documentation to be generated
- Change the names of modules, variables, classes, etc. to comply with the
  naming conventions in: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Frame transformations
---------------------

- Representation of all the frames defined within a robot (one frame per sensor,
  one robot frame). 
- Geo-referenced frames for initial geographic data (define and store a frame
  transformation between the Blender reference frame and an abosolute
  geo-reference frame)
- Camera geometry: associate a projection matrix to each camera
- Respect the usual standards (e.g. for cameras), define and document the other
  choices

Code organisation
-----------------
- One repo for scenarii (morse-scenarii.git)

===============
 LATER TARGETS
===============

User-interface
--------------
- Graphic tree of logic components and their interaction (no meshes, ... )

Architecture
------------
- unified time management ("what if we want to simulate at 2X?")

Simulated component
-------------------
- Simulation of wireless communication between robots: delay, lost of connection, noise...

Linking issues
--------------
- when properties are added in linked components (eg, cameras),
the new properties don't show up in the scene that import these components.

- A lot of room for improvement regarding the general process of linking a robot
component into a scene. Issue with making stuff 'local', lacking a good GUI, when
opening a .blend file, it's not clear what should be imported...

Other stuff 
-----------
- commit policy
- Standardize the scale of objects in MORSE. The 'Grande Salle' scene looks way smaller than the robots


Rosace Project
--------------
- Add timeline of events in the simulation
- Add init script that places the robots and victims specified in a XML file
