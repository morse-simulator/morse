To pick up objects, go to the object and 
move the crosshairs over the object. A open
hand and the object's name should appear.
If not so, the object is certainly out of 
reach.
Press the <left Mousebutton> to grab the 
object. If the object lies on the floor the 
human automatically stoops down.
You can only carry one object at a time.

Pick up the green cup.
