To lay down objects, press the <right
Mousebutton>. On some places objects 
can be placed accurately. In this case
a green rectangle appears where the 
object will be placed. If it cannot be placed
accurately, the object will simply be dropped. 
Move the hand to place the object.

Now place the cup in the cabinet.
