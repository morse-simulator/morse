class RequestManager(object):
    """ Basic Class for all request dispatchers, i.e., classes that
    implement a *request service*.

    A request service offers typically 2 things:
      - the ability for a component (a robot, a sensor or the
        simulator as a whole) to expose a RPC method (typically for
        remote configuration or debug),
      - an interface with a specific middleware to serialize the 
        RPC call and communicate with the outside world.

    Components can register such a service with the 'register_service'
    method. Please check its documentation for details.
 
    To implement a concrete RequestManager (for a new middleware, for instance)
    , the following methods must be overloaded:
        - :py:meth:`initialization`: perform here middleware specific initialization
        - :py:meth:`finalization`: perform here middleware specific finalization
        - :py:meth:`post_registration`: put here all middleware specific code
          that must be executed when a new service is registered.
        - :py:meth:`on_service_completion`: this method is called when a 'long term'
          request completes. You should implement here a way to notify
          your clients.
        - :py:meth:`main`: this method is called at each step of the
          simulation. You should read there incoming requests and write back
          results.
          When a new request arrives, you must pass it to :py:meth:on_incoming_request
          that dispatch or invoke properly the request.

    Subclasses are also expected to overload the special :py:meth:`__str__`
    method to provide middleware specific names.
