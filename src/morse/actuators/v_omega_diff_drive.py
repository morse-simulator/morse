    This actuator reads the values of linear and angular speed and
    applies them to the robot as speeds for the wheels. It only works
    with robots of the type ``WheeledRobot``, such as the :doc:`Segway
    RMP 400 <../robots/segwayrmp400>` and the :doc:`Pioneer 3-DX
    <../robots/pioneer3dx>`.  The movement of the robot is more
    realistic, but also depends on more factors, such as the friction
    between the wheels and the surface.

    The speeds for the left and right wheels are calculated as:

            left_speed = (v - e w) / R
            right_speed = (v + e w) / R

    where:

        - **v** is the linear velocity given as parameter
        - **w** is the angular velocity given as parameter
        - **e** is half of the distance between the left and
        right wheels
        - **R** is the radius of the wheels
