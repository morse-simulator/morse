    **Armatures** are the MORSE generic way to simulate kinematic chains
    made of a combination of revolute joints (hinge) and prismatic
    joints (slider).

    This component only allows to *write* armature configuration. To read the
    armature pose, you need an :doc:`armature pose sensor <../sensors/armature_pose>`.

    .. important:: 

        To be valid, special care must be given when creating armatures. If you
        want to add new one, please carefully read the :doc:`armature creation
        <../../dev/armature_creation>` documentation.


    .. note::

        The data structure on datastream read by the armature actuator
        depends on the armature.  It is a dictionary of pair `(joint name,
        joint value)`.  Joint values are either radians (for revolute joints)
        or meters (for prismatic joints)
