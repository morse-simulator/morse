    """
    **Armatures** are the MORSE generic way to simulate kinematic chains
    made of a combination of revolute joints (hinge) and prismatic
    joints (slider).

    This component only allows to *set* an armature configuration. To read the
    armature pose, you need an :doc:`armature pose sensor <../sensors/armature_pose>`.

    .. important:: 

        To be valid, special care must be given when creating armatures. If you
        want to add new one, please carefully read the :doc:`armature creation
        <../../dev/armature_creation>` documentation.


    This actuator offers two main ways to control a kinematic chain: either by
    setting the values of each joint individually (via a continuous datastream
    or via dedicated services: :py:meth:`translate`,
    :py:meth:`set_translation`, :py:meth:`rotate`, :py:meth:`set_rotation`) or
    by placing the end-effector and relying on a inverse kinematic solver (via
    the services :py:meth:`set_IK_target` and :py:meth:`move_IK_target`).

    .. note::

        When setting the joints with a datastream, the data structure that the
        armature actuator expects depends on the armature itself.  It is a
        dictionary of pair `(joint name, joint value)`.  Joint values are
        either radians (for revolute joints) or meters (for prismatic joints)


    .. note::

        :tag:`ros` Armatures can be controlled in ROS through the
        `JointTrajectoryAction
        <http://wiki.ros.org/joint_trajectory_action>`_
        interface.
