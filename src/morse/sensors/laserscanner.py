class LaserScanner(Sensor):
    """
    This is a generic sensor class used to emulate laser range scanners,
    including a variety of SICK and Hokuyo sensors.

    This sensor works by generating a series of rays in predefined directions, and
    then computing whether any active object is found within a certain distance
    from the origin of the sensor.

    The resolution and detection range can be completely configured using the MORSE
    Builder API.  This will generate a flat mesh with a semi-circular shape, where
    its vertices represent the directions in which the rays of the sensor are cast.
    It is also possible to create a sensor with multiple scan layers, such as the
    SICK LD-MRS. This is configured using the parameters specified below.

    .. note::

        Objects in the scene with the **No collision** setting in their Game
        properties will not be detected by this sensor

    Configuration of the scanning parameters
    ----------------------------------------

    The number and direction of the rays emitted by the sensor is determined by the
    vertices of a semi-circle mesh parented to the sensor. The sensor will cast
    rays from the center of the sensor in the direction of each of the vertices in
    the semi-circle.

    Three preconfigured scanners are available: a **SICK LMS500** laser scanner, a
    **Hokuyo** and a **SICK LD-MRS**. The example below shows how to add them
    in a simulation:

    .. code-block:: python

        from morse.builder import *

        # Append a sick laser
        sick = Sick() # range: 30m, field: 180deg, 180 sample points

        hokuyo = Hokuyo() # range: 30m, field: 270deg, 1080 sample points

        sick_ld_mrs = SickLDMRS() # range: 30m, field 100deg, 4 layers, 400 points per layer

    All these default parameters can be changed i(cf *Configuration
    parameters* below). An example of how to change the arc object using the
    Builder API is show below:

    .. code-block:: python

        from morse.builder import *

        # Append a sick laser
        sick = Sick()
        sick.properties(resolution = 5)
        sick.properties(scan_window = 90)
        sick.properties(laser_range = 5.0)

    .. note::

        In some special cases (like multi-robot setups), you may need to
        additionally call ``sick.create_sick_arc()`` after setting your
        scanner properties.

        The ray will be created from (-window/2) to (+window/2). So the
        ``range_list`` will contain the range clockwise.


    Another example for the SICK LD-MRS:

    .. code-block:: python

        from morse.builder import *

        sick = SickLDMRS()
        sick.properties(Visible_arc = True)
        sick.properties(resolution = 1.0)
        sick.properties(scan_window = 100)
        sick.properties(laser_range = 50.0)
        sick.properties(layers = 4)
        sick.properties(layer_separation = 0.8)
        sick.properties(layer_offset = 0.25)

    As with any other component, it is possible to adjust the refresh frequency of
    the sensor, after it has been defined in the builder script. For example, to
    set the frequency to 1 Hz:

    .. code-block:: python

        sick.frequency(1.0)
