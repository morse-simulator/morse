simulator, you can drop a mail to the `morse-users@laas.fr <mailto:morse-users@laas.fr>`_ 
mailing-list. You can suscribe to the mailing-list
`here <https://sympa.laas.fr/sympa/subscribe/morse-users>`_.

What is MORSE?

.. Introducing MORSE

- A versatile simulator for **generic mobile robots simulation** (single or
  multi robots),
- Enabling **realistic** and **dynamic** environments (with other interacting
  agents -humans- or objects), 
- Don't reinvent the wheel: critical components reused from other open source
  projects (**Blender** for 3D rendering + UI, **Bullet** for physics
  simulation, dedicated robotic middlewares for communications + robot hardware
  support),
- **Seamless workflow**: since the simulator rely on Blender for both modeling
  and the real time 3D engine, creating and modifying a simulated scene is
  straightforward.
- Entirely scriptable in **Python**,
- Adaptable to various **level of simulation realism** (for instance, we may
  want to simulate exteroceptive sensors like cameras in certain cases and
  access directly to a higher level representation of the world -like labeled
  artifacts- in other cases),
- Currently compatible with **YARP** and LAAS OpenRobots robotics frameworks,
- Fully open source, BSD-compatible.

MORSE is partially funded by the `Fondation RTRA <http://www.fondation-stae.net>`_ within the `ROSACE project <http://homepages.laas.fr/khalil/ROSACE>`_ framework.

The MORSE Workflow 
------------------

How to build a complete simulation scenario, from the creation of a custom
robot with predefined sensors and actuators to the complete scene, including
other robots or humans.

Components library
------------------

.. The MORSE robots

MORSE offers an extended set of predefined sensors and controllers that cover 
reasonably well common simulation needs in robotics. It offers also some 
complete robots.

The following page lists all the currently existing components and their
properties:

MORSE has also a mechanism to alter input or output data (like adding noise to
a GPS position) by so called *modifiers*:

To learn how to add new components (sensors, robots...), please refer to the 
:doc:`developer documentation <dev/summary>`.

Supported middlewares
---------------------

MORSE relies on **middlewares** to integrate in your robotic architecture.

It uses both the concepts of **data streams** (in input or output), referred
as *posters*, *topics*, *ports*, ... depending on the middleware, and
**services** (or *requests*, *RPC*...) : data produced or consumed by the
simulator are transmitted through data streams while services enable
remote and on-line configuration of the simulator.

We currently support a generic socket-based interface, `YARP <http://eris.liralab.it/yarp/>`_, `ROS <http://www.ros.org>`_ and
`pocolibs <https://softs.laas.fr/openrobots/wiki/pocolibs>`_. More middlewares may be added in coming versions. Drop us a mail
if you have specific needs.

.. note::
  Some components/services may not be supported by a specific middleware.

On the road-map
---------------

The first release of MORSE contains only a subset of the final simulator specification.

Amongst the planned features for future MORSE releases:

- full compatiblity with the ROS robotics framework (other robotics framework are planned as well. Let us know if you want to contribute in this area),
- support for point cloud sensors (stereo-vision, Velodyne, Kinect,...)
- complete support of the Willow Garage's PR-2 robot, along with all the sensors
- Developement of the user interface,
- Scalablity (both in term of simulation capacity and ease of deployment),
- Multi-node simulations (several Blender nodes can be started on several computer and automaticaly synchronise, which should allow simulations of tenth of robots in the same scene),
- Dedicated supervision node that would allow to: observe the simulation, display logs and metrics, start/stop robots, dynamically alter the scene (like moving an obstacle in front of a robot, etc.).
