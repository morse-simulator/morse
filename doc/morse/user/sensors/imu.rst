Inertial measurement unit (IMU)
===============================

This sensor emulates an Inertial Measurement Unit, measuring the angular
velocity and linear acceleration including acceleration due to gravity.

If the robot has a physics controller, the velocities are directly read from
it's properties ``localAngularVelocity`` and ``worldLinearVelocity``.
Otherwise the velocities are calculated by simple differentiation.
Linear acceleration is always computed by differentiation of the linear velocity.
The measurements are given in the IMU coordinate system, so the location
and rotation of the IMU with respect to the robot is taken into account.
