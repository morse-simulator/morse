Infrared range scanner
======================

This sensor emulates an infrared range scanner, by generating a series of rays 
in predefined directions, and then computing whether they find any object within 
a certain distance of the sensor's origin.

.. note:: Objects in the scene with the **No collision** setting in their Game
  properties will not be detected by this sensor
