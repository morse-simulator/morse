Rosace sensor
=============

This is a multi functional component specific for the ROSACE scenario,
where the robot must be able to aid human victims.
The sensor is capable of detecting any victim located within a cone in front of
the robot, with a range delimited in the properties of the Blender object.
The output of the sensor is a list of the robots and their positions in the
simulated world.
This sensor works only with the `human victim <../others/victim>` object.

Additionally, the sensor provides a number of services related to the
capabilities of the robot to help the nearest victim:

    - Report on the condition of a victim
    - Report the capabilities of the robot
    - Heal a victim (if compatible capabilities and requirements)


In the test scenarios, human victims are shown in *red*. When a robot approaches,
if it has the adequate capabilities, it will be able to help the victims.
When issued the command, the sensor will gradually change the colour of the
victim to *green*, and its status to healthy.
It will detect if a victim is in front of the robot. When instructed to heal the victim,
it will change the Game Properties of the object to reduce its ``injured`` value.

Local data 
----------

  - **victim_dict**: (dictionary) Contains an entry for each of the victims that is
     located inside the cone of the sensor. The value of each entry is a list containing
     the coordinates of the victim object.

Configurable parameters
-----------------------

-  **Heal_range**: (float) maximum distance from which it is possible to heal a victim. Even if
    the victim can be detected by the sensor, it can't be healed unless its distance from the robot
    is less than this value.
-  **Abilities**: (string) encoded string with a list of numbers, separated by comas, that represent
    the equipment capabilities of the robot. This information should be used by the operator of the robot
    to determine if it is capable of helping a victim or not.

The following parameters can be adjusted within the **Logic Bricks** of the ``Rosace_Sensor`` object in
Blender, in the properties of the ``Radar`` sensor.

- **Angle**: (float) aperture angle of the radar capable of detecting the victims.
- **Distance**: (float) detection distance of the radar. Victims further away from the robot than this
    value will not be detected.


Services
--------

- **heal**: (Asynchronous service) Reduce the ``Severity`` value of the victim, and when the value reaches '0', change
    the ``Injured`` status of the victim to False.
    When the victim is healed, the sensor sends out a reply, indicating the new status of the victim.

- **get_victim_requirements**: (Synchronous service) This method will return the string describing the type of injury sustained by the victim.

- **get_robot_abilities**: (Synchronous service) This method will return the string describing the abilities with which the robot is equipped, and which must match the requirements of the victim for the robot to be able to heal it.
