Accelerometer sensor
====================

This sensor emulates an Accelerometer/Podometer, measuring the distance that a robot has moved, the current speed and current acceleration. Measurements are done for the 3 axes (X, Y, Z) for velocity and acceleration.
The values for velocity and acceleration are measured at each tic of the Game Engine, measuring the difference in distance from the previous tic, and the estimated time between tics (60 tics per second is the default in Blender).

Local data
++++++++++

- **distance**: (float) The distance travelled since the last tick
- **velocity**: (float array) Instantaneous speed in X, Y, Z. Computed as distance over time = distance * ticks
- **acceleration**: (float array) Instantaneous change in speed in X, Y, Z. Computed as velocity difference over time = velocity * ticks
