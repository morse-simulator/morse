====== ROS installation for MORSE ======

Blender 2.5x relies on Python3.x which is currently (Jan 2011) not supported by ROS.

The following steps explains how to get a working Python3 ROS setup, suitable for use with MORSE.

  - Install ROS unstable (check http://www.ros.org/wiki/unstable if needed)
  - Install Python3.x (these instructions where tested with Python3.1)
  - Install PyYAML with Python3 support (PyYAML >= 3.09, you can get it from http://pyyaml.org/)
    * Install it with ''python3.1 setup.py install'' to be sure to have the Python3 libraries
  - Replace the ''ros'' and ''ros_comm'' stacks with the versions found here:
    * http://code.in.tum.de/indefero/index.php/p/rospy3-stacks-ros/
    * http://code.in.tum.de/indefero/index.php/p/rospy3-stacks-ros-comm/
    
Check everything run fine by:
  - making sure your default Python executable is Python 3.x (''python --version'')
  - running ''rosmake --pre-clean ros'' and ''rosmake --pre-clean ros_comm''
