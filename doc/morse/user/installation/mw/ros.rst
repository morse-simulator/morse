ROS Installation Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blender 2.57+ relies on Python3.2 which is not yet supported by ROS Electric
Emys but will be partially supported by ROS Fuerte from the upcoming patch 
release 1.8.15. 

If you need to use MORSE with Fuerte right now, please write to the mailing 
list for a preliminary tutorial on how to get a working setup.

To get a working setup suitable for using ROS Electric or Diamondback with 
MORSE, please follow the following steps:

#. Install ROS Electric Emys (check http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation if
   needed)

#. Install Python3.2 manually or using your system package manager and make
   sure, your Pythonpath variable is pointing to the Python3.2-libraries
   (Python3.2 Debian-packages are e.g. offered by Ubuntu 11.04 and newer) 

#. Install PyYAML with Python3 support (PyYAML >= 3.09, you can get it from
   http://pyyaml.org/) Install it with ``python3.2 setup.py install`` to be sure
   to have the Python3 libraries

#. Due to the lacking Python 3 compatibility, you have to overlay some ROS
   stacks: Therefore, you can use rosinstall:

   ROS Electric:

   ``rosinstall ~/ros-py3 /opt/ros/electric
   http://ias.cs.tum.edu/~kargm/ros_electric_py3.rosinstall`` (if your ROS is
   installed in ``/opt/ros/electric`` and your overlay should be created in
   ``~/ros-py3``)
       
   **Note:** rosinstall will create a new setup.bash in the folder *~/ros-py3/*.
   It has to be sourced (instead of the original setup.bash) before using MORSE 
   with ROS.

   You can also use MORSE with ROS Diamondback:

   ``rosinstall ~/ros-py3 /opt/ros/diamondback
   http://ias.cs.tum.edu/~kargm/ros_diamondback_py3.rosinstall`` (if your ROS
   is installed in ``/opt/ros/diamondback`` and your overlay should be created
   in ``~/ros-py3``) 

   The ROS-stacks ros, ros_comm and common_msgs are overlayed by Python3-compatible
   versions and need to be rebuild: ``rosmake ros && rosmake ros_comm && rosmake
   common_msgs``

   **Note:** Rebuilding the common_msgs stack allows you to use all messages in this
   stack for communicating between MORSE and ROS. If you want to use any other
   messages, make sure the source-files are Python2 AND Python3 compatible! This
   can be achieved by simply rebuilding the ROS-packages of the messages with
   rosmake --pre-clean when you are running the patched ROS-stacks (make sure to
   source the right setup.bash!), e.g.: ``rosmake --pre-clean sensor_msgs``
