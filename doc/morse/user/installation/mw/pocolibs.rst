Pocolibs
~~~~~~~~

To build Pocolibs bindings (the LAAS-CNRS middleware), you need to install Pocolibs on your system.

The recommended way to do it is through ``robotpkg`` (see `robotpkg homepage
<http://homepages.laas.fr/mallet/robotpkg>`_ for more informations).

To install::

  $ cd $ROBOTPKG_BASE/robotpkg/middleware/pocolibs
  $ make update
