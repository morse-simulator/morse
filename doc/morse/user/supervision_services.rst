Supervision services
====================

MORSE exposes several services to remotely manage and monitor the simulator.

These services are automatically exposed on a socket interface, on port 4000.

All these services belongs to a virtual component called ``simulation`` and
follows the normal syntax for socket requests.  Thus, a request to retrieve the
list of robots would look like that::

  > telnet localhost 4000
  Connected to localhost.
  > req1 simulation list_robots
  req1 OK ['Robot1', 'Robot2']


Available services
------------------

- ``list_robots`` (no parameter): returns the list of the robots currently
  available in the simulation
- ``reset_objects`` (no parameter): reset the position of all objects in the
  simulation (in other word, restart the simulation)
- ``quit`` (no parameter): quit the game mode and so terminate the simulation

.. note::
  Simulation services are stored in :py:mod:`morse.core.supervision_services`.
