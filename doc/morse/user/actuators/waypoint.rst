Waypoint actuator
=================

This actuator reads the coordinates of a destination point, and moves the robot
towards the given point, with the robot restricted to moving only forward,
turning around its Z axis, and possibly going up and down.
This controller is meant to be used mainly by non-holonomic robots.

While a robot is moving towards a given waypoint, a property of the
**MorseRobotClass** will be changed in indicate the status of the robot.
The ``movement_status`` property will take one of these values: **Stop**,
**Transit** or **Arrived**.

The movement speed of the robot is internally adjusted to the Blender time
measure, following the formula: ``blender_speed = given_speed * tics``, where
**tics** is the number of times the code gets executed per second.
The default value in Blender is ``tics = 60``.

This actuator also implements a simple obstacle avoidance mechanism. The blend
file contains the **Motion_Controller** empty, as well as two additional Empty
objects: **Radar.L** and **Radar.R**.
These detect nearby objects to the left or right of the robot, and will
instruct the robot to turn in the opposite direction of the obstacle.
If the radar objects are not present, the controller will not have any obstacle
avoidance, and the robot can get blocked by any object between it and the
target.

.. note:: For objects to be detectable by the radars, they must have the
    following settings in the **Physics Properties** panel:

    - **Actor** must be checked
    - **Collision Bounds** must be checked

    This will work even for Static objects

-  Python: ``$MORSE_ROOT/src/morse/actuators/waypoint.py``

Local data
----------

- **x**: (float) Destination X coordinate
- **y**: (float) Destination Y coordinate
- **z**: (float) Destination Z coordinate
- **tolerance**: (float) Radius around the target destination where the robot
  is considered to have reached the goal
- **speed**: (float) Movement speed. Rotation speed is used as **speed**/2

.. note:: Coordinates are given with respect to the origin of Blender's
    coordinate axis.

Configurable parameters
-----------------------

- **Speed**: (float) movement speed for the robot, given in meters per second
- **Target**: (string) name of a blender object in the scene. When specified,
  this object will be placed at the coordinates given to the actuator, to
  indicate the expected destination of the robot
- **ObstacleAvoidance**: (boolean) if true (default), will activate obstacle
  avoidance if the radars are present
- **FreeZ**: (boolean) if false (default), the robot is only controlled on 'X'
  and heading; if true, 'Z' is also controlled (for aerial or submarine robots)
- **Ignore**: (string) List of property names. If the object detected by the
  radars has any of these properties defined, it will be ignored by the obstacle
  avoidance, and will not make the robot change its trajectory. Useful when
  trying to move close to an object of a certain kind

These properties can be changed directly from a Builder API script, as in the
following example:

An example of how to change the arc object using the Builder API is show below:

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.builder import *

    # Create a waypoint controller
    Motion_Controller = Waypoint()
    Motion_Controller.properties(Speed = 10.0)
    Motion_Controller.properties(Ignore="Victim_Tag")


Services
--------

- **goto**: (Asynchronous service) This method can be used to give a one time
  instruction to the actuator.  When the robot reaches the destination, it will
  send a reply, indicating that the new status of the robot is "Stop". The
  function can be called with 3 to 5 parameters, corresponding to the variables
  in ``local_data``.  The coordinates are mandatory, while the values for
  **tolerance** and **speed** can be omitted.

    +------------+---------------+------------------+
    | Parameters | ``x``         | float            |
    |            +---------------+------------------+
    |            | ``y``         | float            |
    |            +---------------+------------------+
    |            | ``z``         | float            |
    |            +---------------+------------------+
    |            | ``tolerance`` | float (optional) |
    |            +---------------+------------------+
    |            | ``speed``     | float (optional) |
    +------------+---------------+------------------+

    Parameters: ``(x, y, z[, tolerance[, speed]])``


- **stop**: (Synchronous service) This method will instruct the robot to set
  its speed to 0.0, and reply immediately. If a **goto** request is ongoing, it
  will remain "pending", as the current destination is not changed.

- **resume**: (Synchronous service) Restores the speed to the same value as
  before the last call to the **stop** service. The robot will continue to the
  last waypoint specified.

- **get_status**: (Synchronous service) Ask the actuator to send a message
  indicating the current movement status of the parent robot. There are three
  possible states: **Transit**, **Arrived** and **Stop**.

Applicable modifiers
--------------------

- :doc:`UTM modifier <../modifiers/utm>`: Will add an offset to the Blender
  coordinates according to the parameters set on the scene.
- :doc:`NED <../modifiers/ned>`: Changes the coordinate reference to use North
  (X), East (Y), Down (Z)
