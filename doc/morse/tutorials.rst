Interacting with MORSE
----------------------

Applications have two main ways to interact with the simulator:

1. Using **RPC**-oriented calls, or
2. Using **stream**-oriented interfaces.

RPC calls are typically used to remotely configure the simulator or start
background tasks, while most of data transmissions usually rely on stream-based
interface. Both can be used in MORSE.
