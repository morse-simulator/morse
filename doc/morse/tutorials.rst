Tutorials 
=========

Welcome in the MORSE tutorials section!

As a academic simulator for robotics, MORSE is a large piece of software which
may require some time to master.

However, you should hopefully be able to get very quickly your first
simulation running.

What is the general workflow?
-----------------------------

MORSE relies on the Blender 3D package to run your simulation. To create a
simulation scene, you need to describe it using the **Builder** python API,
which allows you to simply describes simulation scenes. More about that in a
second.

Once you have a description of your simulation, you can run it:: 

 $ morse run <your file>

Now, instruct your :doc:`middleware (ROS, YARP,...)<user/integration>` to address
the simulator instead of the real robot, and start your control softwares as
you would do on a real robot. If you are not relying on an explicit middleware,
you can also use the :doc:`socket interface <user/middlewares/socket>` :tag:`socket`
or the :doc:`Python API <pymorse>` :tag:`pymorse`. MORSE supports the two
classic interaction mechanism provided by most robotic middlewares:

    1. Using **RPC**-oriented calls :tag:`service`
    2. Using **stream**-oriented interfaces. :tag:`datastream`

.. note::

    In various places in the documentation, you will see labels like
    :tag:`builder`, :tag:`ros` or :tag:`service`. They denote the main subjects
    that the section or the tutorial deal with.

The first simulation
--------------------

First of all, :doc:`install MORSE<user/installation>` if it is not already
done.

Next step, :doc:`user/beginner_tutorials/tutorial`. :tag:`builder`
:tag:`socket`

Basic MORSE user interface
--------------------------

The next tutorial describes precisely how to launch the MORSE simulation, and
how to basically interact with him.

Blender specific instructions
-----------------------------

Since MORSE is completely built over Blender, it is important to know some of
its functionality.
