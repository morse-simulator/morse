Adding a new modifier
=====================

The concept of a modifier is relatively simple. Their only function is to
change the data stored in variables in the corresponding component, by using
the concept of :doc:`hooks <../user/hooks>`. 

A modifier is defined by a Python script.
The Python script is responsible for altering the data by changing directly the
information stored in the ``local_data`` dictionary of each component.

.. note:: 

    Be aware that once the data has been changed, there is no way to get the
    original information back.  If there is a need to have both the clean and
    the modified data for a particular sensor, the recommended method is to add
    two sensors of the same type, and only bind one of them with the modifier.

Adding a new modifier
---------------------

Adding a new modifier is a matter of implementing a new class which
derives from :py:class:`morse.modifiers.abstract_modifier.AbstractModifier`.

The only mandatory method to specialize is the ``modify`` method which
contains the actual modification of component data. In this method,
you can use ``self.data`` to access to the ``local_data`` field of the
associated component.


It can be interesting too to override the ``initialize`` and ``finalize``
methods, that contain respectively the initialization code, and the
finalization code. Do not override ``__init__`` and ``__del__``.

If you want to add some parameters to your modifier and to get their
value during initialization, you can use the ``parameter`` method.

Let see an example with a custom modifier that switches ``x`` and ``y``
and the puts ``z`` to a constant value (get from a parameter).

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.modifiers.abstract_modifier import AbstractModifier

    class MyModifier(AbstractModifier):
        def initialize(self):
            """ initialization of parameters ... """
            self.z = self.pamateter("z", default=0)

        def modify(self):
            """" place where occur the data modification """
            x = self.data['x']
            self.data['x'] = self.data['y']
            self.data['y'] = x
            self.data['z'] = self.z

Now, you can test your new modifier directly in the builder:

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.builder import *

    atrv = ATRV()

    pose = Pose()
    atrv.append(pose)
    pose.alter('', 'Path.to.MyModifier')

    env = Environment('empty', fastmode=True)

Last, if you want to use it more easily, you can add some entries in
:py:data:`morse.builder.data.MORSE_DATASTREAM_DICT`.

Examples
--------

:py:mod:`morse.modifiers.ned` shows a simple example for a modifier.
