Adding a new component
======================


Every MORSE component is a **robot**, a **sensor** or an **actuator**.

**Robots** are mainly containers for **sensors** and **actuators**.

This page describes how to create and add new sensors or actuators to MORSE.
Check :doc:`adding_robot` to learn about robots.

General overview
----------------

A component is described by a Python script, which defines its inputs/outputs
and implements its logic.

It may also have a related Blender file, which contains its appearance, and in
special cases, some specific logic. It is however not needed in general.

Depending on your sensors/actuators, you may need to write serialization code
for various middlewares. It is only required if your new component
exports/imports data in formats that are not already supported by existing
sensors/actuators.

Finally, you may want to add your component to the :doc:`Builder
API<../user/builder>` to make it easy for other users to use your component.

These four steps may look intimidating, but most of the boring parts are
automatically generated from templates. We will see an example in a moment.

As a starting point, it is also useful to :doc:`browse the component
gallery<../components_library>` and look for a component similar to the one you
want to build. You can then use it as a reference for our own sensor/actuator.

Creating a new component
------------------------

MORSE offers a convenient command-line tool to create and setup a new component.

Assuming you already have an :doc:`initial simulation
environment<../user/builder>` called ``mysim``, you can create a new sensor
with::

 $ morse add sensor <name> mysim

or, for actuators::

 $ morse add actuator <name> mysim

MORSE asks for a short description, and then creates an initial template for
your component.


The Python part
---------------

You need to implement a sub-class of :py:class:`morse.core.sensor.Sensor` if creating a new sensor, 
or of :py:class:`morse.core.actuator.Actuator` if creating a new actuator.

Let's begin by creating a custom sensor to read an image. First, you must define the
``_name`` field and the ``_short_descr`` field to describe your component.

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.core.sensor import Sensor

    class MyImageSensor(Sensor):
        
        _name = "MyImageSensor"
        _short_descr = "A custom Image Sensor"


Defining exported data fields
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Components import (for actuators) or export (for sensors) data. These data are
declared as a set of *data field*s specific to the component, accessible
through the ``local_data`` map. You must use the
:py:meth:`morse.helpers.components.add_data` method to declare your component's fields.

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.core.sensor import Sensor
    from morse.helpers.components import add_data

    class MyImageSensor(Sensor):

        _name = "MyImageSensor"
        _short_descr = "A custom Image Sensor"

        add_data("image", None, 'rgba buffer', 'the data captured by the ImageSensor, stored as a Python Buffer ...')
        add_data('matrix', None, "mat3<float>", 'long description')

Defining properties for your component
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is possible to define properties for your components, i.e. some variables
which allow your component to be configured. For example, you may want to set the
size of your image. To declare such properties, you need to use the
:py:meth:`morse.helpers.components.add_property` method. 

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.core.sensor import Sensor
    from morse.helpers.components import add_data, add_property

    class MyImageSensor(Sensor):

        _name = "MyImageSensor"
        _short_descr = "A custom Image Sensor"

        add_data("image", None, 'rgba buffer', 'the data captured by the ImageSensor, stored as a Python Buffer ...')
        add_data('matrix', None, "mat3<float>", 'long description')

        add_property('image_width', 256, 'image_width', 'int', 'width of the image, in pixels')
        add_property('image_length', 256, 'image_length', 'int', 'width of the image, in pixels')

.. warning::

    Unlike ``add_data``, you may only use basic types with
    ``add_property`` (bool, float, int, string). Indeed, here, we rely on the
    blender game property system to pass values between the builder script and
    the code logic, and this only supports these basic types.

Defining the logic of your component
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that we have defined the interface of our component, we need to define its
internal logic. There are two important functions that you want to override.

- the init function (``__init__``). In this function, you can create and
  initialize private attributes (which won't be exported to other MORSE
  layers). Do not forget to call the ``__init__`` method of your parent
  class, to properly initialize the component.

- the ``default_action`` method contains the logic of our component.  Avoid
  doing any big computations here: the function is called often, and it will
  slow down the whole simulation if it takes too much time to execute.

  * For a sensor, you want to compute the values of the different elements
    of your ``local_data`` using the current simulator step. See, for
    instance, :py:meth:`morse.sensors.pose.Pose.default_action`.

  * For an actuator, you want to **modify** the simulated scene based on
    the values stored in the ``local_data`` dictionary. See, for instance,
    :py:meth:`morse.actuators.v_omega.MotionVW.default_action`.

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.core.sensor import Sensor
    from morse.helpers.components import add_data, add_property

    class MyImageSensor(Sensor):

        _name = "MyImageSensor"
        _short_descr = "A custom Image Sensor"

        add_data("image", None, 'rgba buffer', 'the data captured by the ImageSensor, stored as a Python Buffer ...')
        add_data('matrix', None, "mat3<float>", 'long description')

        add_property('image_width', 256, 'image_width', 'int', 'width of the image, in pixel')
        add_property('image_length', 256, 'image_length', 'int', 'width of the image, in pixel')

        def __init__(self, obj, parent = None):
            # Call the constructor of the parent class
            super().__init__(obj, parent)

            # Initialize some private variable
            self.capturing = False
            # ...

            # Initialize some field of local_data
            self.local_data['matrix'] = mathutils.Matrix()
            # ...

            # Inform the user that everything is fine
            logger.info('Component initialized')

        def get_raw_image(self):
            #...

        def default_action(self):
            self.local_data["image"] = self.get_raw_image()

.. note::
    Note that you never directly communicate with middleware inside a component.
    Everything goes through the ``local_data`` structure. This lets your code
    be largely middleware independent.

    To put it another way: your component **must not** have any middleware
    specific code.

.. note::
    
    You may want to add services to your component. Please read
    :doc:`services` to learn how to add services to a component.


Defining abstraction levels
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A component can define several levels of abstraction, also called levels of
*realism*. One interesting example is the :py:mod:`morse.sensors.odometry`
which defines three levels of realism, corresponding to different degrees of
integration.

These levels consist of:

- a custom set of data fields,
- and/or a custom component class implementation.

Levels are defined with the helper function
:py:meth:`morse.helpers.components.add_level`. The function
:py:meth:`morse.helpers.components.add_data` can take an extra argument, which
represents the level of the data (data will appears only at this level of
realism). If not present, the data is available to all realism levels.

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.core.sensor import Sensor
    from morse.helpers.components import add_level, add_data

    class MyImageSensor(Sensor):
        """ This imaginary image sensor can either provide 'raw' images,
        or denoised images.
        """

        # We define 2 levels for this sensor:
        add_level("raw", None, "provides raw data")
        add_level("processed", "path.to.my.MyProcessedImageSensor", "provides cleaned images", default=True)

        add_data("image", None, "rgba", "raw image", level = "raw")
        add_data("image", None, "rgba", "denoised image", level = "processed")
        add_data("noise_level", None, "float", "level of removed noise", level = "processed")

        #add a constructor...

        def get_raw_image(self):
            #...

        def default_action(self):
            self.local_data["image"] = self.get_raw_image()

     class MyProcessedImageSensor(MyImageSensor):

        #add a constructor...

        def clean_image(self, image):
            # ...

        def default_action(self):
            image = self.get_raw_image
            cleaned, level = self.clean_image(image)

            self.local_data["image"] = cleaned
            self.local_data["noise_level"] = level


Here, we define two level of realism, the `raw` one and the `processed`
one. The `raw` level is implemented directly by `MyImageSensor` while the
`processed` level is handled by `MyProcessedImageSensor` class.

We may observe that the `processed` level has a flag `default=True`. While not
mandatory, it is recommended to define a default level to allow the use of
your component with minimal configuration.

A user would configure this sensor in a script like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.builder import *

    robot = ATRV()

    image = MyImageSensor()
    image.level("processed")
    robot.append(image)

    ...


.. _blender-advice:

The 'Blender' part
------------------

- First, create a nice model of your component.

  * Center it around ``<0,0,0>``
  * 1 Blender unit = 1 m
  * ``x`` points forward, ``z`` points up.
  * You can of course import meshes in Blender. Just check the scale and orientation.
  * Remember that your mesh will be used in a real-time 3D engine: keep
    the number of polygons low (check the ``decimate`` tool in Blender to
    simplify your model if needed).
  * Remember the :doc:`bounding boxes<../user/tips/bounding_boxes>`.
  * If your sensor/actuator has a kinematic structure (not a single rigid part),
    use Blender's armatures to model it precisely (see the note on
    armatures below)..

.. note::

    You may have some elements in your Blender scene (like lights or a physical
    floor to test physics) that you would like to keep while creating the model,
    but you do not want MORSE to import them in the final simulation. Simply
    prefix their name with ``_`` in Blender: MORSE will ignore those.

- Save the model in ``$MORSE_ROOT/data/<sensors|actuators>/``

Make sure that the `Parent Inverse
<http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/User:Pepribal/Ref/Appendices/ParentInverse>`_
is identity, otherwise your sensor might have an offset when parented to your
robot even if you specified zero as location.

You can inspect this matrix from the python console:
    ``bpy.data.objects['your_object_name'].matrix_parent_inverse``
And set it to identity again if needed:
    ``bpy.data.objects['your_object_name'].matrix_parent_inverse.identity()``

Specific case of armatures
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Armatures** are the MORSE way to simulate kinematic chains made of a
combination of revolute joints (hinge) and prismatic joints (slider).

They require special care to be successfully crafted. Please refer
to the :doc:`armature creation<armature_creation>` page for details.


The Builder Part
----------------

Now that you've created your component's logic, you need to define a builder
class. This will allow you to create an object in the Blender interface, which
will call your logic code every *n* frames of the simulation.

- Sensors must extend :py:class:`morse.builder.creator.SensorCreator`. Have a
  look at :py:class:`morse.builder.sensors.Pose` for a simple example.

- Actuators must extend :py:class:`morse.builder.creator.ActuatorCreator`.
  Have a look at :py:class:`morse.builder.actuators.MotionVW` for a simple
  example.

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.builder.creator import SensorCreator

    class PTUPosture(SensorCreator):
        def __init__(self, name=None):
            super().__init__(name, "morse.sensors.ptu_posture.PTUPosture")


For a basic mesh, you can use classes from the :py:mod:`morse.builder.blenderobjects`
module.

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.builder.creator import SensorCreator
    from morse.builder.blenderobjects import Sphere

    class GPS(SensorCreator):
        def __init__(self, name=None):
            super().__init__(name, "morse.sensors.gps.GPS")
            mesh = Sphere("GPSSphere")
            mesh.scale = (.04, .04, .01)
            mesh.color(.5, .5, .5)
            self.append(mesh)

If you want to add a specific mesh from an external ``.blend`` file,
use :py:meth:`morse.builder.creator.ComponentCreator.append_meshes`.

.. code-block:: python

    from morse.builder.creator import SensorCreator

    class Sick(LaserSensorWithArc):
        def __init__(self, name=None):
            super().__init__(name,
                    "morse.sensors.laserscanner.LaserScanner", "sick")
            # set components-specific properties
            self.properties(Visible_arc = False, laser_range = 30.0,
                    scan_window = 180.0, resolution = 1.0)
            # set the frequency to 10 Hz
            self.frequency(10)
            # append sick mesh, from MORSE_COMPONENTS/sensors/sick.blend
            self.append_meshes(['SickMesh'])

In this case, we append the ``SickMesh`` Blender object from the ``sick.blend``
file in *MORSE_COMPONENTS*/*sensors* directory.
